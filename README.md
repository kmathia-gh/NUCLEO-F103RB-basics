# STM32F1_HAL_Blink
This is a version of the well-known 'Blink' example for getting started with the STM32 series of microcontrollers, here using a NUCLEO-F103RB development board with the STM32F103RBT8 processor. The example is part of a package for the STSTM32 platform on Github's PlatformIO page.
The original example code is for the F0 series and was adjusted for the F1 series. The ST HAL library is used (HAL .. hardware abstraction layer). Similar Blink examples use the ST SPL library (SPL .. Standard Peripheral Library), which is still available but is gradually being replaced by HAL.
Software development platform: VScode, PlatformIO IDE
