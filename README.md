# STM32F1_HAL_Blink
A version of the well-known 'Blink' example to get started with the STM32 series of microcontrollers.
Here the NUCLEO-F103RB development board is used. It has a STM32F103RBT8 processor.

The example is one of many examples available on Github's PlatformIO page for the STSTM32 platform:
https://github.com/platformio
https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/tree/master
https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/tree/master/examples

The original example code is for the F0 series and was adjusted for the F1 series.
